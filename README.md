## Guidelines

- For development and testing purposes we provide you with two API keys and two example URLs. We assume that the URLs and their
responses are self-explanatory. Please do not include the provided api keys within the repo.
- Google Maps native SDK should be used for displaying trip history on a map.
- When deciding the architecture of the app please consider the resulting application as an MVP for potentially larger project.
